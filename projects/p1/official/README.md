Project 1 : Night at the movies
by Junior Vigneault for CART 263
Prof : Pippin Barr


"Kill Bill, The Play" is a one woman show inspired by Quentin Tarantino's fourth film Kill Bill Vol. 1. My simulation is an experimental game project that explores the relationship between art and entertainment.
Through the artist performing, the user attempts to put on a show for the audience. My goal was to create a simulation where the user feels responsible for what is happening on the stage and how the public reacts to it. By creating an awkward silentish soundscape using room tone and buzzing sounds and contrasting that with loud reverberated sounds coming from the stage, the attention is centered on the actor, creating a humoristic tension on what is going to happen, and how the crowd will react to that action. With this project, I wanted to talk about what makes art ART, and how recognition and gratification from the public influences the creation process.  

Unfortunately, I did not manage to cross the finish line with this project. It's weird because I was super confident during the three first weeks. I really thought I was working on a great idea, but when I finally put all of the pieces together and tested it, I realized I didn't have a fully realized, well rounded idea to push forward. During the first weeks, I had not fleshed out the core concept of my game, and I thought that would come up eventually while building the environment and learning how to work with the new libraries.
It was only a week before deadline that I had to rethink key aspects of the project.
It really threw me off because I was sure I was going to make something that was going to make you (Pippin Barr) laugh and find awesome.

Having had time to think about my initial inspiration with this project, I now I have a clear Idea of what I want it to be, but it's kind of too late, at least for the academic deadline.

Here is my plan :

ACT 1 -
* The user controls the actor on stage and tries to figure a way to entertain the crowd using the controls. The awkward silence and reverb enhances the failure of the user at this stage.
* The user finds a Katana on the stage.
* When the user presses space bar, the actor emits a "HAA!" sound (a sample from a fight scene in the movie Kill Bill). while thrusting the Katana in the air. At first, the crowd is timid to react but there is a small change in the sound environment.
* The more the times this happens (space bar), the crowd starts clapping and shouting, making the user want to continue.
* The audience starts to grow and more people start arriving, clapping and shouting with enthusiasm. If the user stops pressing space bar, the clapping and shouting stops too.
* This act lasts for about 1 minute.

** ENTRACTE ** // curtain goes down again and crowd chats for a couple seconds

ACT 2 -
* Same thing as Act1, when thrusting the sword the audience is really enthusiast, even more than act 1.
* After a couple of seconds, someone from the audience comes on stage.
* The user eventually thrusts the katana at the audience member on the stage and it cuts him in half, making the crowd go insane with applause and screaming. There is also a insane amount of gushing blood (I wanted to use matter.js to create a kind of infinite spill of red pixels violently exploding and spreading on stage, referencing the graphic violence used in Kill Bill).
* The curtain comes down and people stand up for an ovation.

It would be an escalation of emotion and humour until the final violent scene. This scene would be surprising and unsettling while still being funny.

I feel a bit embarrassed because I know that there is really not much going on in terms of playability and interaction.
I'm still happy because I learned a ton doing this project, even more than the two projects before. I worked with the physics engine matter.js and understood how to implement it in my program. I used the play.js library to create animations and sprites. I created (with your help) a sound library (that I ended up not using) and I got even more familiar with OOP, inheritance and polymorphism.

I also learned a lot about what kind of ideas are good and bad in terms of programming. When you don't have experience (like me) you don't know that certain things are more complicated than others and that you have to think a certain way OR have a certain type of idea. I'm understanding what's effective and what's not. I hope my hard work will still translate!
