Alien Parenting
by Junior

My project is about taking care of the basic needs of an Alien in a tank full of black fluids until the alien turns 18 years old.

This project took 1000 different turns but I'm happy with the outcome, considering the circumstances. I really like the minimalist design and I think it will be fun to continue building on it. The ending is not what I want it to be, the death as well. I would also like to make it more meaningful by adding more options when taking care of the alien including questions about parental decisions.
